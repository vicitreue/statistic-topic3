# Statistical Analysis of Reaction Time Data

This program was developed to automate statistical calculations on large datasets as part of a term paper for the course **"61381 Praktikum Mathematische Statistik – SoSe 2025"** at **FernUniversität in Hagen**.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between two sets of reaction time data recorded from sprinters — one set collected during training and the other during competition.

## Data

The project includes input files containing reaction times from two groups:

- **Training group**
- **Competition group**

These datasets are used to perform various statistical tests to evaluate the significance of any observed differences.

## Statistical Methods Applied

The following statistical tests are implemented in this project:

- **Mann-Whitney U-Test**
- **t-Test for independent samples**
- **Monte-Carlo-Simulation**
- **Levene-Test for Equality of Variances**
- **(ANOVA Test)** _(optional)_
